    subject_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    topic TEXT NOT NULL,
    chapter TEXT NOT NULL,
    page_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
    completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    time_spent_minutes INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(student_id, subject_id, topic, chapter, page_number)
);

-- Performance indexes added for efficient querying
```

#### 3. **Enhanced API Endpoints** (`backend/api/`)
```python
# New Subjects API Endpoints:
GET /subjects/{id}/topics/{topic}/chapters/{chapter}/pages
GET /subjects/{id}/topics/{topic}/chapters/{chapter}/pages/{page_number}

# New Students API Endpoints:
GET /students/{id}/page-progress
POST /students/{id}/page-progress
