# AI Tutor - Offline LLM Learning Platform

A 100% local-first AI tutor designed for the Jetson Orin Nano (8 GB) that provides personalized education without requiring internet connectivity.

## Overview

This application provides multi-student desktop learning with webcam-based face recognition login, personalized curriculum generation, and interactive lessons. Built for the Gemma 3n Challenge to make high-quality education accessible in remote, low-connectivity regions.

## Features

### Current Implementation (Stage 0-1)
- âœ… **Multi-student desktop application** with modern GUI
- âœ… **Webcam-based face recognition** for secure login
- âœ… **Student profile wizard** with difficulty level selection
- âœ… **SQLite database** for local data storage
- âœ… **Robust error handling** and logging

### Planned Features (Stage 2-6)
- ðŸ”„ Subject catalogue and curriculum generation
- ðŸ”„ Interactive lesson chat with LLM
- ðŸ”„ Auto-generated MCQ quizzes with grading
- ðŸ”„ Performance optimization for Jetson Orin Nano
