# AI Education Platform

> **Personalized learning powered by AI, designed for complete offline operation**

An intelligent tutoring system that adapts to each student's learning style and pace, generating custom educational content tailored to their interests and goals. Built for deployment in environments without internet access.

## üéØ What Makes This Different

**Truly Personalized Learning**  
Students describe what they want to learn in natural language ("I want to understand how websites work" or "I'm curious about space exploration"), and our AI creates customized subjects and curricula that match their exact interests and learning level.

**Complete Offline Operation**  
Runs entirely on local hardware without requiring internet connectivity - perfect for remote schools, secure environments, or areas with limited connectivity.

**Adaptive Difficulty**  
Each student can set their own learning level (Foundation to Expert) for every subject, ensuring content is neither too easy nor overwhelming.
